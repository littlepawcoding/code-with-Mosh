// Control flow exercises (loops)

// 1) Write a function that takes two numbers and returns the maximum of the two.

// Kat's attempt:
let x = 5;
let y = 2;

function maxNum(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

// ah I fully didn't understand the question! I thought it was asking for the total of the two numbers and to return it, instead its asking for the largest of the two numbers.

// Kat's attempt 2:

let a = 77;
let b = 34;

function max(a, b) {
  if (a > b) {
    console.log(a);
  } else console.log(b);
}
// if a, 28 is greater than b, 94 then print a
// otherwise print b
// hmm this is still not working

// Solution:
